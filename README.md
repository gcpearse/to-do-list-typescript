This project was built by following Piyush Agarwal's YouTube [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJDVKeh7RJI) for freeCodeCamp.org. The source code for his original Taskify app can be found [here](https://github.com/piyush-eon/react-typescript-taskify).

My app deviates somewhat from Piyush's version, but maintains the same functionality.
