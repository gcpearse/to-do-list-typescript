This project was built by following Piyush Agarwal's [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJDVKeh7RJI) for freeCodeCamp.org. The source code for his original Taskify app can be found [here](https://github.com/piyush-eon/react-typescript-taskify).

My app deviates slightly from Piyush's original code, but maintains the same functionality.
