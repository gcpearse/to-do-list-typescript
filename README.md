This project was built by following Piyush Agarwal's YouTube [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJDVKeh7RJI) for freeCodeCamp.org. The source code for his original Taskify app can be found [here](https://github.com/piyush-eon/react-typescript-taskify).

The majority of the functionality in Taskyard is shared with Piyush's Taskify app, but there are some additional features, and alternative styling has been applied to most elements.
